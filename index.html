                Did you know that, according to the national institute of health, cycling is not only one of the most climate friendly methods of transportation, but even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8516176/" target="_blank">traveling as little as 3km per day</a> leads to "statistically significant increase in physical fitnesss"? Biking regularly is associated with not just physical health benefits, but mental health benefits as well.
